    "\n",
    "Transformation functions are functions that can be applied to a training data point to create another valid training data point of the same class.\n",
    "For example, for image classification problems, it is common to rotate or crop images in the training data to create new training inputs.\n",
    "Transformation functions should be atomic e.g. a small rotation of an image, or changing a single word in a sentence.\n",
    "We then compose multiple transformation functions when applying them to training data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common ways to augment text includes replacing words with their synonyms, or replacing names entities with other entities.\n",
